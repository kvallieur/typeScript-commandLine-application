# typeScript-commandLine-application
A simple command line application introducing concepts of Typescript

# Quick Start
run the following command at package.json level. It is only a one time thing. 

```sh 
$ npm i
```
This creates the node_modules folder and downloads the dependencies. 

## running as a npm project
- `package.json` contains the task `start`
 the `start` task executes the typescript compilation and runs the index.js file
- The argument required is a Git Username. Console prints the Top Five repos and some user info

```sh 
$ npm start <GIT Username>
```
